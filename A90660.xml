            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now, here is endeavoured, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the neceſſity of Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to ſhew what Worſhip is and how God is to be Worſhipped as alſo, to vindicate Magiſtracy,

            </p>
            <p>I might here take occaſion to inſert ſomething <hi>in patrocinium,</hi> ſhewing my ſelf willing, (howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver weak) to be an Advocate for the Religious Subject, who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious in Worſhipping God, and in honouring and obeying the <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> Supream and Subordinate; a little to plead the Cauſe of ſuch, againſt the Obloquies, Criminations, and Calumnies of Detractours, and Calumniatours: But, if the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this ſmall Book, anſwer the ſcope and Title, (as I hope it doth) the intelligent obſervant Reader will find that work to be done there.</p>
            <p>But before I diſmiſs thee <hi>[Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der]</hi> let me advertiſe thee, that what is written in the following
<pb facs="tcp:152324:4"/>ſheets, was Preached from the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit in a Country Village, and ſo fitted for, and ſuited to the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities and Concernments of the hearers; and what it was, the ſame it is, for matter and form, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented now to publick view, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that it may probably meet with many Readers, whom it may alike fit, and equally concern, and with whom it may find no leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance; (though I doubt not, but it will likewiſe meet with many Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <hi>Momuſſes,</hi> and Cenſuring <hi>Ariſtarchuſſes</hi>).</p>
            <p>The Reader may be pleaſed, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take notice, That the firſt part of the latter Text,
[viz. <hi>the Propoſition or Aſſertion of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right and Authority of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy</hi>] was opened and managed <hi>(Pro Authoris Modulo)</hi> on a day of Thanksgiving for the peaceable and happy Reſtauration of our <hi>Royal Soveraign, CHARLES the II.</hi> to his Throne and Royal Dignity:
<pb facs="tcp:152324:4"/>Not long after his before deſired; much longed for, and then joyful, congratulated Return, the <hi>Non-conformiſt</hi> was and is <hi>Loyal;</hi> could, while he had liberty, Preach for the <hi>Royal</hi> Intereſt; and can, and doth ſtill, pray for the higher <hi>Powers: Reverſus ad Dominum, revertatur magis ac magis uſque ad Dominum.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Phariſees</hi> are troubled at the ſucceſs of Chriſt his Miniſtry; they thought that all was well when <hi>John</hi> was rid out of the way: but ſee! here comes another who is a greater grievance to them, as making more Diſciples than <hi>John</hi> made. So they thought themſelves ſure when Chriſt was crucified; but Chriſt before his death raiſed up twelve more, ſending them to preach the Goſpel; of whom he ſaith, that they ſhould do greater things than himſelf.</p>

            <p n="2">2. Looking to the former note, whereof this latter is an illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we may ſee matter of great comfort to Believers and Saints, who have received Chriſt by Faith, and have true Grace in their hearts; they have that which is ſatisfactory, and that which will ſtay with them to miniſter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and delight to them for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: They can never fall away wholly, and return to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer eſtate, to be without Chriſt,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:152324:15"/>to be deſtitute of Grace and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life; but the Fountaine is ſtill theirs, and that which flows from the Fountain to them, into them, doth prove a Fountain in them; and we know that a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain cannot be exhauſted or dried up: However the great water brooks of hypocrites fail in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's drought, yet the little Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain water of God his Children holds out; and though true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may have their thirſtings, and may be as the parched ground (as <hi>David</hi> complains, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.4. that his moiſture was turned into the drought of Summer) yet the godly ſhall not thirſt ſo, but that this living water, Chriſt and his Grace, ſhall be a Fountain ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, and yielding water to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive their thirſt, ſo that it ſhall not be a killing thirſt: Excellently ſaith <hi>Chryſ-ſtome;</hi>

            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:152324:15"/>

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Chriſt takes another courſe to provoke this womans thirſt after his grace; and that is by convincing her of the need ſhe hath of it, awakening her to a ſenſe of her preſent condition, as being a filthy Harlot, living in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs. <hi>Call thy husband,</hi> ſaith our Saviour. <hi>I have no husband,</hi> ſaith ſhe. <hi>Thou ſayſt truly,</hi> ſaith Chriſt: <hi>For thou haſt had five hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and he whom thou now haſt,</hi> i. e. with whom thou accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieſt, as if he were thy husband, <hi>is not</hi> indeed <hi>thy husband.</hi> This wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (as 'tis like) had lived long in this filthy courſe, keeping her filthineſs cloſe from men, and without any ſmitings of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for it; but now Chriſt comes home unto her, charging her with uncleanneſs.</p>

            <p>A Divine perſon is, <hi>Modus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinae Eſſentiae,</hi> the Divine Eſſence modified. The three perſons in the Divine Eſſence, are the Divine Eſſence conſidered three manner of ways,<note place="margin">

            <p>We are to obſerve the order of the ſubſiſtence of theſe Divine Perſons. In order of ſubſiſting, the <hi>Father</hi> is before the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> before the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> but we muſt know that they are equal in regard of Time, Majeſty, Glory
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:152324:24"/>and Eſſence. The <hi>Father</hi> is the firſt perſon, exiſting from himſelf, not from any other, in reſpect both of Eſſence and Perſon.<note place="margin">Joh. 1.14</note> The <hi>Son</hi> is the ſecond perſon, who, in the conſideration of his perſon, doth exiſt from the <hi>Father</hi> by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal generation;<note place="margin">

The <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> or <hi>the Spirit,</hi> is the third perſon, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his perſon, proceeding and flowing from the Father and the Son; but in reſpect of Eſſence,<note place="margin">Joh. 15.26.</note> being God of himſelf, with the Father and the Son.</p>
            <p>And we muſt know, that<note n="*" place="margin">Deus ſunt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confuſe trinus in unitate; indiviſe unus in trinitate. 1 Jo. 57.</note> the Trinity of perſons doth not take away, or deſtroy, the Unity of the Divine Eſſence, (as the Unity of Eſſence denies not the Trinity of perſons) <hi>theſe three are one.</hi>

Prayer is to be directed to God the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt; but we muſt not pray to either of the perſons, but as united to the other.

Now here in the Text, when the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is named, the other two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are included. We are to call upon God the Father, in the name of his Son, by the help of his Spirit.

            <p>Well, this is that which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour teacheth in this one and twentieth Verſe; That in the new Teſtament diſtinction of place, for the worſhip of God, is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and that the Temporary Prieſthood, and External Rites are aboliſhed by Chriſt his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.

As for you <hi>Samaritans,</hi> ye worſhip ye know not what, nor how: though you will ſay, you have a good meaning, and direct your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip unto God, and pretend the example of your fathers; yet foraſmuch as your worſhip is not directed or warranted by the Word

            </p>
            <p>God himſelf is turned into an Idol, when people have falſe groſs apprehenſions of him, and worſhip him with any other than Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-worſhip, (ſuch as is order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or allowed by the Word of God; I ſay) when people have carnal, groſs, unſuitable appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of God, or do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of him aright in his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, Properties, and Relations, as he hath revealed himſelf in his Chriſt, they worſhip an Idol in ſtead of God; and it is vain idle worſhip when people follow their own or other mens inventions in ſtead of God his preſcriptions.

            <p>Yea, ſuch Will-worſhip of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane invention, is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profitable to us, or pleaſing to God, that God accounts it done to Devils, not to him: This is no raſh aſſertion of mine, or <hi>gratis dictum.</hi> Ye may read it in Scripture,<note place="margin">Levit. 17.7.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:152324:30"/>they are charged with <hi>ſacrifiſing unto Devils.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 11.15. Rev. 9.20.</note> And <hi>Jeroboam</hi> his Idols are called <hi>Devils,</hi> and ſo are Antichriſt his Idols.</p>
            <p>This is God his eſtimation and cenſure of Idolatrous worſhip, and all deviſed fictitious worſhip, wch is not according to God's own appointment, wherein men wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip an Idol of their own brain: whatever they intend or pretend, not God, but the Devil, is ſerved by ſuch forbidden uninſtituted worſhip. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renounce the true God, but pretended and intended ſtill the worſhip of God, when upon a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick account he ſet up the Calves in <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Dan:</hi> nor did the people that went up thither, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the worſhip of Devils; yet God in his Word tells us, that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſet up this worſhip to Devils.</p>
            <p>O how cautelous ſhould men be, and fearful, leſt they worſhip Devils inſtead of God? how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to keep cloſe to God his Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions?</p>

            <p>Well then, it follows hence,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the worſhip of <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> is an idle Idol-worſhip, becauſe they worſhip God out of Chriſt; conceiving far amiſs of that God whom they pretend to worſhip; and making an Idol of him, (there being no ſuch God made known in the Word, to be the Object of worſhip.</p>

            <p>The Dialogue or Colloqui be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and this woman, is from the nineteenth verſe, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:152324:33"/>about the Worſhip of God; concerning which, the Woman puts forth a Queſtion to Chriſt, and deſires to be reſolved by him, in the twentieth verſe; <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers worſhipped in this Mountain, and ye ſay, that in Jeruſalem men ought to worſhip:</hi> Whether are we or you in the right?</p>
            <p>Our Saviour's firſt Anſwer, was (as I have already hinted) to this effect: That ſhe needed not to be be ſolicitous about this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe neither of theſe two wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips was long to continue. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me woman, <hi>The hour cometh, when ye ſhall neither in this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, nor in Jeruſalem, worſhip the Father.</hi> Here he teacheth her, that there ſhall be an abrogation of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Ceremonies, and of the whole <hi>Levitical</hi> Service; for under the name or title of the place of worſhip, <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he comprehends the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> worſhip, which, for the moſt part of the Ceremonies, was by God's appointment to be performed there, and not elſewhere.</p>
            <p>Well; but though neither of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:152324:33"/>theſe worſhips muſt long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, yet for the preſent, one is right, or one is better than the other. Which is that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not yours</hi> (ſaith Chriſt,) <hi>but ours;</hi> Yours is ſtark naught, for <hi>ye worſhip ye know not what:</hi> your worſhip hath no word of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting or warranting it: but <hi>we worſhip that we know;</hi> our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is grounded upon the Word of God:<note place="margin">Rom. 3.2</note>

            <p>Object. <hi>But if the Jewiſh wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip be grounded upon the Word of God, how ſhall it be aboliſhed?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> To this Chriſt anſwers, that God had preſcribed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that way of <hi>Moſaical</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, not for perpetuity, but only
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:152324:34"/>to continue till the fulneſs of time ſhould come;<note place="margin">Gal. 4.1, 2, 3, 4. Heb. 9.10</note> till the <hi>time of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; i. e.</hi> till the time of the New-Teſtament, when (all that was ſignified by thoſe Ceremonies and outward Services, being ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in Chriſt) that temporary Ceremonious worſhip ſhall be changed into a ſpiritual and more excellent worſhip, which ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be abrogated: And Chriſt tells the Woman, that now the term of that <hi>Levetical</hi> worſhip is expired, (the Meſſiah being come to put an end to it.</p>
            <p>Here is the ſumme of Chriſt his Anſwer. There is a double Word of God reſpecting his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; One Word concerning the <hi>Levitical</hi> worſhip, delivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was to be in force till the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> that word belongs not to the New-Teſtament worſhippers. There is another word concerning the Spiritual Worſhip of God, that is perpetual; which word alſo the Patriarchs before the Law, and the godly under the Law, did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; (though both before and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:152324:34"/>under the Law, it was hooded and cloathed (as it were) with certain Ceremonies appointed by God; but now in the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this is the voice and plain open expreſſion of the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word, <hi>[The true Worſhippers, ſhall worſhip the Father in Spirit and in Truth.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Connection of the words, which I have made out as plainly and as briefly as I might.</p>
            <p>The Text is an aſſertion of the true nature and ſtate of right Goſpel-worſhip,<note place="margin">Text de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided &amp;</note> with a double reaſon to confirm it.</p>
            <p>Goſpel-worſhip is aſſerted to be a worſhip in Spirit and in Truth.</p>
            <p>Now of this there are two De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt Demonſtration is drawn from the <hi>Will</hi> of God: <hi>The Father requireth ſuch to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him:</hi> God ſtands upon it, to have ſuch Worſhippers, and this is the worſhip which he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, which will pleaſe him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Demonſtration is taken from the Nature of God;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:152324:35"/>he is <hi>a Spirit,</hi> a pure ſpiritual Eſſence; therefore the worſhip done to him muſt be <hi>Spiritual,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to his Nature.</p>
            <p>The true Nature and ſtate of Goſpel-worſhip is aſſerted in the former part of the Text: <hi>The true Worſhippers ſhall [now] wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in Spirit and in Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall a little open theſe words, and then conclude ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from them:<note place="margin">opened.</note> 
               <hi>The hour cometh, i. e.</hi> the time is at hand: Here he teacheth, that the Moſaical Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances were not perpetual, but impoſed onely for a time, and that they were at this time even out of date.</p>
            <p>Yea, the hour <hi>[now]</hi> is, <hi>viz.</hi> in part, Chriſt being come, hath already obſcured the grace of the legal-worſhip: and Now is the time of reformation: Now the time is come, that the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers ſhall worſhip after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner: The Temple and Prieſt-hood, and ritual worſhip, which hitherto have been uſed with approbation, muſt hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth be laid aſide, and now the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:152324:35"/>Father muſt be worſhipped <hi>[in Spirit, and in Truth.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To let paſs theſe various ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the terms, <hi>Spirit and Truth;</hi> I ſhall onely ſhew you what is the import of theſe tearms here; what it is <hi>to worſhip in Spirit, and in Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That we may underſtand this, we muſt note the <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> here intended by our Saviour; he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth Goſpel-worſhip to both the former worſhips ſpoken of in the Context; that of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and that of the <hi>Jews;</hi> the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan</hi> worſhip was hypocritical and counterfeit, not that which God had appointed, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals or externals of it; it was heartleſs devotion, and uninſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted worſhip; and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> worſhip, as to the external part of it (as inſtituted by God) ſtood in Meats and Drinks, and divers Waſhings, and Carnal Rites, and Ordinances, ſo called by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles;<note place="margin">Heb. 9.10</note> and the inſtitution of that worſhip is ſaid to be <hi>The Law of a Carnal Commandment;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 7.19</note> and the generality of the <hi>Jews</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:152324:36"/>were ſo groſsly carnal in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the buſineſs of Religion, that they ſtuck in the outward Ceremonies, having no reſpect at all to internal and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual worſhip, nor minding that which was ſignified by thoſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal rites and ſhadowes: but if the Ceremonial Law were obſerved in offering Sacrifices, and in the point of Meats, and Drinks, and Waſhings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they reckoned that all was well enough: This is that which God upbraideth them with, and for which he ſharply repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and threateneth them.</p>
            <p>Now according to the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi> here intended; <hi>[Spirit]</hi> ſignifies the heart, and its renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpiritual motions and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, together with the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe affections, in ſuch outward actions as neceſſarily flow from them: <hi>[Truth]</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies ſincerity, as oppoſed to hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie; and it ſignifies the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubſtance and kernel of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that worſhip which is rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and ſubſtantial, which ſtands in the <hi>Truth</hi> of thoſe figures and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:152324:36"/>ſhadowes, that which was figured by thoſe legal Sacrifices, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ceremonial Ordinances, that which is indeed the thing that God looketh after; and <hi>[Truth]</hi> likewiſe importeth a conſonancy to the Word of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>True</hi> worſhip is that which is ordered and commanded by God, that which is according to the Rule.</p>
            <p>So then, worſhip <hi>in Spirit and in Truth</hi> is oppoſed to the Carnal Ceremonious worſhip of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to the heartleſs and deviſed worſhip of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> which was a falſe worſhip, wanting the Rule of God's Word, appointing and warranting the matter of it, as well as the truth of a good heart, for the manner of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Worſhip in Spirit and in Truth</hi> is ſincere, ſpiritual, inſtituted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Scripture-worſhip, which hath the Word of God, for its foundation and rule. This is true right Worſhip.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>Did not the true worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in the Old Teſtament, worſhip

The Word of God is the Chriſtian's Rule for his whole
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:152324:44"/>practice; nothing ought to be done, but what the Scripture commands or allows.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In worſhipping and ſerving God, we muſt have reſpect to the <hi>whole</hi> revealed Will of God; to do <hi>all</hi> that he hath commanded: <hi>Ye ſhall obſerve [all] my Statutes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lev. 19.37.</note> 
               <hi>and [all] my Judgements, and do them:</hi>

               <hi>Ye ſhall teach them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and do
[all] things whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I have commanded you:</hi> We muſt not half it with God in the buſineſs of Religion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That which we do in the Worſhip of God, the matter whereof is God his Command, muſt be done <hi>[as commanded]</hi> with conſcience of Gods Command, &amp; in Obedience to it, with reſpect to God's Will, that in doing it, we may pleaſe him; <hi>I will praiſe the Name of God,</hi> ſaith <hi>David;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 69.30.31.</note> 
               <hi>This ſhall pleaſe the Lord: Paul</hi> prayeth for the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> that they may <hi>Walk worthy of the Lord unto all well pleaſing.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 1.10</note>
            </p>
            <p>This is that which a Chriſtian ſhould look to in all his ſervices: This is my duty, God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:152324:45"/>it, and in doing this I ſhall pleaſe God; therefore I will do it.</p>
            <p>Thus I have briefly ſhewed you the extent of worſhip, reſpecting the matter of it, <hi>all duty, omne praeceptum,</hi> all that God hath commanded, with a limitation, <hi>tantum praeceptum,</hi> onely that which is commanded, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation, <hi>quâ praeceptum,</hi> as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>

            <p>There are divers ſignifications of the Word <hi>[Faith]</hi> in Scripture, which I ſhall not now trouble you with, but ſhall plainly ſhew the meaning of this fourth Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for the opening of our deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We muſt worſhip God <hi>[i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> judgment and conſcience, that what we do, ſuits with the mind of <hi>God,</hi> and ſo that it is his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that which he requires and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:152324:45"/>approves of; as the Apoſtle in the caſe of indifferent things, in point of eating or not eating ſuch and ſuch Meats, and touching the obſervation of dayes, ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.5.</note> 
               <hi>Let every man be fully perſwaded in his own mind:</hi> This is the Apoſtle his meaning there. Though <hi>to eat,</hi> or <hi>not to eat</hi> be indifferent in it ſelf; yet let every man take heed in eating, or forbearing to eat, and ſee that he doth it with knowledge; being well perſwaded that what he doth, is pleaſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>God.</hi> Let him that eateth be ſure, that he doth not ſin in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and let him that forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth be ſure, that he offends not <hi>God</hi> or his brother in forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Now, whereas the Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſuch a full perſwaſion about things indifferent; much more is it required about neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary things, which <hi>God</hi> hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or forbidden, that in theſe matters we be well reſolved of what we take up in practice. A man may do that which <hi>God</hi> commands, and forbear that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:152324:46"/>which he prohibits; and yet ſin in ſuch an action or omiſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what he doth, he doth not with knowledge, his action pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not from a judgement well informed, and ſo he doth it not upon good grounds: It greatly concerns us, that our worſhip be according to knowledge. <hi>Whatſoever is not of Faith</hi> (in this ſence) <hi>is ſin;</hi> It is ſin for us to do any thing in the worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> ignorantly and doubtingly: we muſt be well perſwaded that the action pleaſeth <hi>God,</hi> as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he hath commanded it, or allowes it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There muſt be <hi>[Faith]</hi> in our worſhip, <hi>i. e.</hi> Faith to eye <hi>God,</hi> and to deal with him, in every religious duty or exerciſe. <hi>Faith</hi> to believe in <hi>Prayer,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> can and will hear and help, and give us that which we ask in his Son's Name. <hi>Faith</hi> in reading and hearing the Word of God, to believe that it is true in its predictions, and promiſes, and threatenings, and to apply it to our ſelves. <hi>Faith</hi> in the uſe of all
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:152324:46"/>Ordinances, to believe that God will accept us in them, and bleſs them to us for good.
<q>There muſt be <hi>Faith</hi> to ſee aſſiſtance in the power of God, and to fetch ſtrength from the promiſe,<note place="margin">T. M.</note> and to ſee acceptance in the Grace of God, and a Reward in the Bounty of God.</q> This Faith muſt be in our Worſhip, that it may be pleaſing to God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God muſt be worſhipped and obeyed in Faith <hi>[through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ the Mediator] i. e.</hi> There muſt be an application of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Grace, and an affiance on Jeſus Chriſt, for the acceptance of our perſons and ſervices. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Mediator we cannot come neer unto God; our beſt ſervices are ſo faulty and ſo filthy, that in themſelves they are rather a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring of God than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and therefore cannot be pleaſing to God, but onely through Jeſus Chriſt, in whom the Father is well pleaſed. Therefore when we worſhip God, we muſt gather into Jeſus Chriſt, and lay
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:152324:47"/>hold upon his Righteouſneſs; and preſent our ſervices to God through Chriſt; and leave our duties with Chriſt to be offered by him to his Father, and our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they may be accepted through him, as from him, and for his ſake.</p>
            <p>I ſhall inſiſt a little longer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this forth Poſition, that we are in hand with, further to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the neceſſity of Faith in the Mediator, unto a right worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſhall ſhew it reſpecting Prayer in particular, and then reſpecting all Worſhip in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
            <p>Firſt, reſpecting Prayer, Faith is neceſſary, To ſet Prayer on foot, and To carry on the work and duty of Prayer, and To the concluding of Prayer with an <hi>Amen,</hi> and To keep the heart in a right frame after Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is neceſſary to ſet Prayer on foot, or to bring the Soul to Prayer: Can a man have any ſtomack to go and crave, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:152324:47"/>make requeſt, where he hath no hope to ſpeed? Now where ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual <hi>Faith</hi> is not, there can be no hope to ſpeed in any ſuit to God; and that upon this two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold account.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is upon account of the relation, in which any ſoul ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto <hi>God,</hi> that it can have any hope of obtaining that which it ſeeketh from <hi>God:</hi> It is the conſideration of <hi>God</hi> his Father-Hood and our Son-Ship, that muſt bring us to Prayer, giving us encouragement to go to <hi>God</hi> with our petitions.

               <hi>and go to my Father.</hi> A Child hath reaſon to hope that his Father will hear him, and do for him, when he cannot expect it from a ſtranger. Now, how come we into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of <hi>God,</hi> to have him to be our Father? How come we to have the Son-ſhip of Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, by vertue of which we may be admitted into the preſence of <hi>God,</hi> and be received by him? See that Scripture;<note place="margin">John 1.12.</note>

We cannot look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſelves, but as ſinful guilty perſons, nor upon our duties, but as very defective. The Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which we muſt have, that we may be accepted of God, muſt be a Righteouſneſs out of our ſelves, another's Righteouſneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which yet muſt be ours, that it may do us good: Now it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ours by <hi>Faith;</hi> the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which gives us acceſs to God by Jeſus Chriſt, is <hi>the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of Faith,</hi>

               <hi>the Righteouſneſs</hi> of God which is <hi>by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, unto all and upon all that believe:</hi> Now for as much as without this Righteouſneſs we can have no hope God-ward; How can we with any confidence draw neer to God, till ſuch time
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:152324:48"/>as by Faith we cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt, and apply his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to our ſelves? Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count Faith is neceſſary to ſet Prayer on foot, to ſet the Spirit of Prayer on work.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Faith is neceſſary to carry on the work of Prayer, and for the diſcharging of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we may with humble, holy boldneſs, with a Child-like confidence, pray unto God:<note place="margin">Eph. 3.12</note> 
               <hi>In whom we have boldneſs and acceſs with confidence, by the Faith of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That we may lift up holy hands in Prayer. <hi>I will,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that men pray every where,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.8.</note> 
               <hi>lifting up pure hands, without wrath or doubting:</hi> It is Faith that purifies the heart;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.1</note> 
               <hi>Having theſe promiſes, let us cleanſe our ſelves form all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyneſs of the fleſh and ſpirit.</hi> Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations concerning the Love and good Will of God, concerning Chriſt, and Grace, do purge the Soul that takes them in.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Faith is neceſſary for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging of the heart in Prayer:
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:152324:49"/>and to make us lively and earneſt in praying: <hi>I believed, therefore have I ſpoken.</hi> The believing Soul will utter it ſelf, and even pour it ſelf forth before the Lord: being perſwaded, it ſhall through Chriſt obtain, at the hands of God, that Grace which it ſues for: but the Unbelieving heart is ſtraitned; and where Faith is not, fervency cannot be; and where fervency is not, the ſucceſs of prayer is doubtful, at leaſt. The effectual <hi>fervent Prayer</hi> of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man availeth much</p>
            <p n="3">3. Faith is neceſſary to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding of our prayers with an <hi>Amen;</hi> teſtifying, as our deſires to have our petitions granted, ſo our reliance on God, and a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion that he will, for Chriſt his ſake, grant our requeſts: For it is by Faith that we leave our prayers with Chriſt, in whom all the promiſes of God are Yea and <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Faith ſets and keeps the Soul in a right frame after Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It ſets the heart at reſt, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:152324:49"/>keeps it quiet. When I conſider that Chriſt hath the offering up of my prayers, and that God will not throw aſide any of the petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which his dear Son brings to him, this quiets my heart:<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1.18.</note> 
               <hi>When</hi> Hanna <hi>had prayed, ſhe did eat and her countenance was no more ſad:</hi> If ſhe had not Faith, her ſtomack would have been no better, nor her heart quieter after Prayer, than it was before: but now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that God had looked on the affliction of his Hand-maid, and that he would give her that bleſſing which ſhe prayed for; now, I ſay, ſhe goes away rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in the goodneſs of God, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by Faith, and eats her bread with a merry heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> being among many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and in the midſt of dangers,<note place="margin">Pſa. 3.5.</note> having prayed, could lye down and take his reſt; believing that the Lord would preſerve and deliver him, as he had pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Faith ſets the Soul, and keeps it, in a patient, waiting frame; and this is that which
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:152324:50"/>God requires, and that which he loves;<note place="margin">pſa. 27.13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>I had fainted,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, unleſs I had believed to ſee the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord in the land of the living; wait on the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's</hi> Faith reſting on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, upheld him to wait on the Lord for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his promiſe. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us,<note place="margin">Hebr. 10.36.</note> 
               <hi>We have need of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, that after we have done the Will of God,</hi> (viz. in praying, and uſing ſuch means as God hath appointed) <hi>we may receive the Promiſes:</hi> There is a Promiſe of God to waiting Souls;<note place="margin">Iſai. 30 18</note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed are they that wait for him:</hi> Now it is onely the believing Soul, that is a waiting Soul;<note place="margin">Iſai. 28.16</note> 
               <hi>He that believeth, will not make haſt.</hi> The godly are ſpoken of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123.2. as having confidence in God, and waiting for his goodneſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Faith keeps the heart in a praying diſpoſition &amp; frame, ſets the Soul on work, to pray again and again, often to ask the ſame things, till we have a clear and full Anſwer from God: And Faith makes the Soul importunate with
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:152324:50"/>God, ſtill riſing higher and higher in holy importunity: I believe that this Mercy will come, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Prayer; therefore I will pray inſtantly that it may come, and conſtantly till it doth come.</p>
            <p>Thus Faith is neceſſary with reſpect to prayer-worſhip, which is indeed a principal part of the Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Faith is neceſſary to the Worſhip of God in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or to all Worſhip: and that upon this account, or for theſe reaſons:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe, to the worſhip of God, there is required a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Will, and of the Rule of Worſhip; and an aſſent unto, and approbation of, the Truth, and Holineſs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Revelations, and an Intereſt in him: Can a man wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip he knows not whom? or when he underſtands not how, he is to worſhip? or when he is not perſwaded in his own conſcience, that what he doth is right? or when the Soul hath no recumbency on the Object of Worſhip? Now this
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:152324:51"/>knowledge, and this aſſent, and this perſwaſion, and this recum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bency, is Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Without Faith the Soul hath no way to God, and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not draw nigh to him in Worſhip: Jeſus Chriſt is our onely way to God, in him we have acceſs with boldneſs and confidence to the Throne of Grace: Now it is Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, which gives us the benefit of this way; no Faith, no Chriſt; no Chriſt, no way to God; no poſſibility of any approach unto him without a Mediator; for God out of Chriſt is a conſuming Fire, and poor Chriſtleſs Souls have cauſe to fall into trembling, when they think of God. Now faithleſs ſouls, are Chriſtleſs; and without Faith the Soul hath no acceſs unto God, or communion with him; therefore Faith is neceſſary to the Worſhip of God: It is only in this way of recumbencie by Faith on Jeſus Chriſt, that the Soul hath any peace toward God, and hope and comfort in it's approaching unto him. While we look unto weak,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:152324:51"/>corrupt, ſinful Self, and upon our own imperfect, faulty, ſinful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, there muſt needs be doubts and fears, and unquietneſs of ſpirit; <hi>Being juſtified by Faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5.1</note> 
               <hi>we have Peace toward God:
[Peace]</hi> i. e. that tranquility of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or that comfort and joy, which a Believer hath in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſprinkled with the blood of Chriſt, and that boldneſſe which he hath toward <hi>God,</hi> as being his Father in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Faith is neceſſary, to the worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> becauſe where Faith is not, there can be neither will nor ability for any hold acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for any duty of worſhip: What deſire can the Soul have to draw near to God, till it hath ſome hope through Chriſt of it's acceptance with God? till it hath ſome hold-faſt on the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of <hi>God</hi> his Love? ſo long as the Soul is eſtranged from Chriſt, it is a ſtranger to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> is a ſtranger to it: Till there be an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> between Chriſt and the Soul, (even a Marriage <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi>) there will be no deſire of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:152324:52"/>or Spiritual Intercourſe; Chriſt his <hi>Spouſe</hi> is delighted to ſee him, even thorough the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, to hear his voice at the door, but ſhe rejoyceth greatly to be with him in the Galleries, to have his company in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; delighteth to enjoy him in Ordinances, and converſe with him in worſhip: Where there is ſuch an Union to Chriſt, there is pleaſure in ſeeing him, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, joy to be with him. The Soul having taſted the ſweets of his Love, deſires to be led up to a more full enjoyment of him; and ſo is making toward him in the uſe of means, in attending on Ordinances, and performing Duties. Now this Union, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and the Soul, is by the means of Faith; it is by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that the Soul comes to be one with Chriſt, and ſo to be deſirous of converſing with him, to delight in his Ordinances and Worſhip. Again, It is by Faith, that the Soul, being made one with Chriſt, doth fetch ſtrength and abilities from Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:152324:52"/>whom we can do nothing that good is: Of Chriſt his fulneſs, the believer receiveth grace for grace: Chriſt dwelling in the heart by Faith, makes a holy heart, is the worker of Grace in the heart, and furniſheth the Soul with abilities for Duty; that the Soul being juſtified, and ſo ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by him, may ſerve <hi>God,</hi> and worſhip him acceptably.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> There is one thing more, which is conſiderable in the deſcription of Worſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> the End of it; concerning which, our Concluſion is this.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Concl. </seg>5</label> 5. The main end which we muſt aim at in all our Worſhip and Service, is, That <hi>God</hi> may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by us.</p>
            <p>This is <hi>God</hi> his great end of all his Works, of all his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Commands, even his own Glory. <hi>God</hi> hath made all things for himſelf, and he will have all to be done to him:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.31.</note>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:152324:53"/>him to be ſuch a <hi>God,</hi> as he in his Word and Works hath diſcovered himſelf to be, we make a ſutable profeſſion in Word and Deed, really acknowledging his Power, and Wiſdom, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and Goodneſs, and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and the reſt of his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and Properties, reverently and humbly worſhipping and ſerving the onely true <hi>God,</hi> to whom all Worſhip and Service is due from us; referring all our actions to the right end, termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating all in him: <hi>Paul</hi> would have the <hi>Philippians</hi> to be <hi>filled with the Fruits of Righteouſeſs,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thus I have finiſhed the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Point, explaining the Subject briefly, and the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute more largely.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Proof. </seg>
               </label> Now for Proof of the Doctrine, I ſhall refer you to the whole Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Story; Look thorow the Book of <hi>God,</hi> and you ſhall find it veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in all true Profeſſors, that the Scripture maketh mention of; they were all worſhippers of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:152324:53"/>
            <p>I ſhall give you two words for the demonſtration of the Point, <hi>viz. That true Profeſſors of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, are worſhippers of God, according to the Principles and Rules of the Religion which they profeſs; that real Chriſtians do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed worſhip the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Demonſtration ſhall be</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the true ſtate of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</note> and of a profeſſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Religion</hi> properly notes a right acknowledgment, and holy pure worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> according to the rule laid down in his Word. And <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> is a plain, open, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our owning, embracing, and adhering to, the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now, <hi>Profeſſion</hi> may be either that which is <hi>verbal</hi> only, or that which is <hi>real,</hi> as well as verbal; and the profeſſion real may be either regular or irregular.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Verbal profeſſion,</hi> practically contradicted, is invalidated by ſuch a contradiction, ſo that it is to be accounted as no profeſſion: He that in word profeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:152324:54"/>to be of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Worſhipper of <hi>God</hi> in Chriſt, and yet in practice, is [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] one that doth not worſhip <hi>God;</hi> ſurely he is no true Profeſſor: Nor is he a true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of Religion, who, though he doth act ſomething in the worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> yet acteth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and worſhip.</p>
            <p>Religion and Chriſtianity is not a meer Notion, but it is ſomething Practical; it notes not only the Minds reception of, and the Wills ſubſcription to, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and rules of Chriſtianity; but alſo the framing of the heart, and of the whole man, to be act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and working in thoſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Rules.</p>
            <p>Thus ſtands the Argument.</p>
            <p>A true profeſſion of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is real; there is practical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Chriſtianity in the life; and it is Regular, ſo that the buſineſs of Religion, the true Profeſſour acteth according to Rule; therefore they who truly profeſſe the Chriſtian Religion,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:152324:54"/>and are true real Chriſtians, are real and regular Worſhippers of <hi>God</hi> the Father.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It muſt needs be,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</note> that true Chriſtians are real worſhippers of God, becauſe they are poſſeſſed and acted by the Spirit of God and Chriſt; which Spirit is the efficient of holy Worſhip, leading Souls to it, and acting them in it: Every thing acteth according to it's Principles;<note place="margin">Principi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondet ſuis prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiis.</note> Chriſtians are principled by the Spirit of Chriſt, which doth efficaciouſly incline and govern them to do that which is pleaſing to Chriſt. The Spirit's in-Being, is argued by the Spirit his working in the Soul: The Spirit of Chriſt is a ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit, that ſets the heart right toward God, and orders the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation aright, in all points of holy Obedience; ſo that they who have this Spirit, muſt needs be worſhippers of God.</p>
            <p>Now I have diſpatched the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal part of my Diſcourſe;<note place="margin">Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> I come to Application: I ſhall make but two Uſes of the Point; The firſt for Conviction; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:152324:55"/>a Uſe of Exhortation.</p>

            <p>If all true <hi>Goſpel-profeſſors,</hi> be true Worſhippers; then they who are not true Worſhippers, are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Chriſtianity: What a number o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:152324:55"/>them, do not ſet themſelves to glorifie him for his Mercies?</p>
            <p>Ah Souls! Do you chooſe <hi>God</hi> for your portion and cheif good? Do you affectionately accept of Jeſus Chriſt to be your Saviour and Lord, not only acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Sufferings, and accepting of Pardon and Salvation through him, but alſo acknowledging his Soveraignty, and ſubmitting to his Government and way of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Where there is not ſuch a choice of God, and ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of Chriſt, there is not that Faith which is a part of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Worſhip. Do you love God above all inferiour earthly things, loving theſe things but with a love ſubordinate to the love of God? Where God is not thus loved, the Soul doth not worſhip him. Now, alas! how doth Self-love, Creature-love, love of the World, yea, and the love of Luſts, ſhut God out of the affections of very many of us?</p>
            <p>Where is that fear of God to be found, which, in all addreſſes to God, compoſeth the Spirit by
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:152324:56"/>an awful apprehenſion of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite diſtance which is betwixt God and Us? Where is that fear of God, which fenceth the Soul againſt temptation unto ſin, and is operative and inſtrumental unto holy walking? How few true Penitents are there, that diſallow and deteſt fin, and carefully ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from it; and do actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt it, and turn from all ſin unto God, unto Piety and acts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</p>
            <p>Now Friends, If you do not believe, do not love God, and fear him, and turn to him, what Religion is in you? what is your Profeſſion? where is your Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity?</p>
            <p>And now, for external Worſhip, to try men upon that account.</p>
            <p>Some are not worſhippers ſo much as in appearance, practiſe no worſhip in their Families, and ſeldome appear in the place of publick Worſhip.</p>
            <p>And ſome there are (alas! how many) that are worſhippers only in appearance; their Worſhip is meerly External, they draw not
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:152324:56"/>near to God with their Spirits in any act of Worſhip; nor is that which they do in point of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, done with Conſcience of God's Command, or with any reſpect to his Glory, or with Faith in the Mediator.</p>
            <p>And how much vain Worſhip is taken up, which is not ordered by God, but by men; which is not according to pure, holy, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitutions, but according to corrupt, rotten, human <hi>inventions?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now gather up all this, and hence take conviction home to your ſelves.</p>
            <p>You that do not acknowledge God in your hearts and lives: You that do not believe his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and believe in his Son; You that love the world, and love ſin, but love not God; You that do not reverence the Holineſs and the Majeſty of God, that ſtand not in awe of his Word, that are not afraid to ſin againſt him; You that will not turn from your ſins unto God; You that regard not to worſhip God in publick and in private; and you
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:152324:57"/>whoſe Worſhip is meerly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal: Take Conviction to your ſelves, that you are not right Goſpel-profeſſors, or real Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, foraſmuch as you are not true Worſhippers.</p>

            <p>The Apoſtle tells us,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> that <hi>God is a plentiful rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him:</hi> that call upon his Name, and worſhip him, and truſt in him; ſo that it is not in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:152324:57"/>vain to ſerve the Lord: There is <hi>profit</hi> in keeping his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Though our Worſhip muſt not be mercenary, we muſt not look only or chiefly at the reward, ſerving God for our ſelves, for our own advantage; yet having looked at <hi>God</hi> his Glory, and aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a conformity to his Will, we muſt go on in <hi>God</hi>'s way, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the reward, for our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and encouragement. The Apoſtle preſſeth this Argument upon himſelf and others;<note place="margin">Heb. 12.28.</note> 
               <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we receiving a Kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have Grace, whereby we may ſerve God accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, with reverence and godly fear;</hi> and this he illuſtrateth by inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the danger of not worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and ſerving <hi>God; for our God is a conſuming Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And with this Argument <hi>Moſes</hi> preſſeth the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to a care of true Worſhip, and due O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; <hi>Take heed unto your ſelves, lest ye forget the Covenant of the Lord your God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 4.23, 24.</note> &amp;c. <hi>for the Lord thy God is a conſuming Fire, even a jealous God.</hi> God hath power to

            <p>I will add but one word more, to excite you to a care of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <hi>God</hi> aright: Look again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Scripture, and you ſhall find that <hi>God</hi> hath engaged his Name, and his Truth, to ſave the people that call upon his Name, that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him in Truth: See for this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.13.<note place="margin">Rom. 10.13.</note> The former verſe endeth thus, <hi>The ſame Lord over all, is Rich unto all that call upon him.</hi> Now he doth by Scripture confirm this, [that <hi>God</hi> is rich in Mercy to all true Believers, and holy Worſhippers] he calls in the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> to atteſt this; <hi>For whoſoever ſhall call upon the Name of the Lord, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Here
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:152324:59"/>is a promiſe of Temporal and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Salvation, to ſuch as in Faith, worſhip <hi>God</hi> with a holy Worſhip: They ſhall be ſaved with a temporal Salvation; ſaved in trouble, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſupported under it, and ſaved from trouble, in due time delivered out of it: and they ſhall be Eternally ſaved, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the Wrath to come, and received up to <hi>Glory,</hi> to live with <hi>God</hi> for ever.</p>
            <p>Now, let this be the great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to perſwade you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Worſhippers of <hi>God,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint your ſelves with <hi>God,</hi> and give your ſelves up to him, to ſearch out, and to ſtudy his Will, and to give him the Worſhip and Service of the inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man; performing all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Worſhip regularly, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scripture-Rule.</p>
            <p>The Text laſt mentioned, tells you who ſhall be ſaved; <hi>viz. They that call upon the Name of the Lord.</hi> i. e. ſuch as know and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>God,</hi> and believe his Word, and believe in his Son; and love, and fear <hi>God,</hi> and ſtrive to pleaſe

            <p>Thus I have diſpatched the firſt Point which is implied in the Text; <hi>viz.</hi>

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:152324:60"/>ſuitable to Goſpel-times, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Goſpel-rule.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Now to open the Predicate, that you may ſee what it is to <hi>Worſhip God in Spirit and in Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not trouble you with the various ſignifications of theſe tearms <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> but only ſhew you what is the proper no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, in our Text and Doctrine.</p>
            <p>I have already told you, that our Saviour here oppoſeth <hi>Goſpel-worſhip,</hi> to both the former Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips ſpoken of in the Context; that of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and that of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> The <hi>Samaritan</hi> Worſhip was Hypocritical, and Counterfeit, invented worſhip; not that which God had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either for the internals or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals of it: It was heartleſs Devotion, and uninſtituted Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Worſhip, as to the External part of it, (as Inſtituted by God) ſtood in meats and drinks, and divers waſhings, and legal purifications, and in offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               </label> The Text is (as a clear founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo) a full proof of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and our Saviour tells the Phariſees,<note place="margin">Mat. 15.9</note> that <hi>In vain do they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, teaching, for Doctrine, the Commandments of men.</hi> That is a vain idle Worſhip, an unprofitable Worſhip, which is ordered other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:152324:63"/>than God hath appointed, which is not directed to the true God rightly conceived of; and performed in a right manner, ſuitable to his Will and Nature, and which hath not God's Word for its foundation and Rule. This was an obſervation which you had from the 22 verſe, which Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Ye worſhip ye know not what.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for demonſtration of the point: We have two demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Text. This aſſertion <hi>[That true Goſpel-worſhip, is a Worſhip in Spirit, and in Truth]</hi> is proved.</p>
            <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</note> From the <hi>Will of God, The Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him:</hi> This is the argument here uſed: They that worſhip God, muſt ſee that their Worſhip be ſuch as will pleaſe God. Now onely ſuch ſpiritual, ſincere, inſtituted-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip pleaſeth him: Therefore onely ſuch Worſhip is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond reaſon is drawn from the <hi>Nature of God; God is a Spirit:</hi> he is a pure, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:152324:63"/>Eſſence, and he muſt be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped with a Worſhip, ſuitable to his Nature: Thus to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God is reaſonable ſervice.</p>
            <p>God is a Spirit, in a kind of ſingularity, and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and eminency, above all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
            <p>God is a moſt <hi>Intelligent</hi> Spirit; his underſtandig is infinite. They who ſatisfie themſelves with a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal external Worſhip, ſuch as is but a Carcaiſe, without any Soul of Heart-devotion in it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holy, ſpiritual motions, and affections, of the inward man; theſe apprehend not God to be <hi>a Spirit,</hi> the God and Father of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and the ſearcher of hearts, but deny his Spiritual Nature, and make him a God of fleſh, while they bring ſteſh to him for an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering: If God be a Spirit, he muſt be worſhipped with our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and truly, he calleth for this, <hi>My Son give me thy heart:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 23.26.</note> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requires a preparation of the heart for Worſhip, and the activity of the inward man in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Worſhip; and the Soul's
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:152324:64"/>intentneſs upon the work in hand. God loveth ſpiritual performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>Again, God is a Spirit, moſt <hi>ſimple,</hi> void of all Compoſition, and uncapable of diviſion: Such muſt our Worſhip be, ſuitable to the moſt ſimple Nature and Being of God: It muſt be <hi>uncompounded, undivided</hi> Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There muſt be no Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in it, no mixture of our own conceits, and devices, or any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inventions; a patched, ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticated, linſey-woolſey-worſhip fuits not with the ſimplicity of God, the Object of Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There muſt be no diviſion in our Worſhip, it muſt be whole entire Worſhip, head and heart; underſtanding and affections; Soul and Body; all muſt joyn unanimouſly in the Worſhip of God.</p>

            <p n="2">2. There is a corruption in the manner of Worſhip, when it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in formality, without any care of preparation for it: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attention and affection in it; when there is no Soul-labour, no Spirit-work in all our Worſhip, but a reſting in the bare outward act; and when that which people do in point of Worſhip is meerly out of cuſtome, or for faſhions-ſake, without any true reſpect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:152324:65"/>God, or tendency of the Soul unto him: And when peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple behave themſelves careleſsly, irreverently and rudely in the place and time of VVorſhip; and while they themſelves pretend to be worſhippers: This is corrupt, rotten Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="3">3. VVorſhip is horribly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, in reſpect of the kinds and parts of it, by taking away from, or adding to, Gods Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or making an exchange with God, following our own fancies, or other mens inventions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of God his preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Now, Worſhip that is thus cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, any of theſe wayes, is not true Goſpel-worſhip, or that which is approved of God. <hi>True Goſpel-worſhip</hi> is <hi>pure</hi> VVorſhip: Now that is <hi>pure</hi> VVorſhip, for the <hi>Object</hi> of it, which is exhibited to the true God alone, conceived of according to the Revelation of him in Scripture: And that is <hi>pure</hi> Worſhip, as to the <hi>manner</hi> of it, which is performed reverently, conſcionably, ſpiritually, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately.

            <p>Thus you have the Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the point: <hi>True Goſpel-worſhip is a Worſhip in Spirit and in Truth.</hi> For</p>

               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:152324:69"/>let him be honoured with a more decent, ſplendid Worſhip, ſuch as we give him: But men ſhall one day find, that God will give them no thanks, for going about to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him with their gawdy Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. Well, beloved; If this be a note of the true Goſpel-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that it ſhall not be Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but Spirit; then ſurely the Popiſh Ceremonious Worſhip, and all Worſhip that is modell'd in imitation thereof, cannot be true worſhip: And I pray let this be conſidered, (which I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly hinted to you) that they who burden the Church with a multitude of Ceremonies, go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to deſtroy Goſpel-worſhip, which muſt not be Ceremonious; and do what in them lieth to caſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> out of the Church, and to bring in <hi>Moſes</hi> again; and they who affect, and plead for, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in, and practiſe, a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Worſhip, ſeem to forget that theſe are Goſpel-times.</p>
            <p>And if men ſhall alleadge, that many of the vulgar ſort have as much need of ſuch helps, as the

               <hi>Jewes</hi> had; ſurely this is a vain plea: for we muſt alwayes conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how <hi>God</hi> will have his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to be managed; ſurely, he knows what is beſt, and what is neceſſary and expedient.</p>

            <p>All Goſpel-worſhip is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſure, pure foundation of Divine Goſpel-inſtitutions. The Word of God doth appoint and order the Worſhip which he will have, in every Eſſential part of it; and it is a general Rule for Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantials: It doth not indeed particularly command and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every circumſtance, but the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:152324:70"/>Church muſt take heed that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Circumſtances, and under pretence of Church-power herein, ſhe do not bring in Worſhip. Meer Circumſtances belonging to religious Actions, are left to Humane determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but it is not left unto men to appoint any kinds, parts or means of Worſhip: Now Ceremonies properly ſacred, and ſignificant by Humane Inſtitution, are judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be more than Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to be indeed parts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to be Ceremonial Worſhip; and that Worſhip which is not commanded by God, is not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, approved Worſhip. We have in the Scripture ſtrict prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions of adding to the Word of God:<note place="margin">Deut. 4.2</note>

            </p>
            <p>Then, there are two great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, to enforce this Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God will reprove ſuch Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to his Word.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God, who is Almighty, and infinitely wiſe, and holy, and juſt, will take in hand ſuch Corrupters of his Name and Word, ſo that he will demonſtrate to them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of, their horrible wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in adding to his Word, by foyſting in mens inventions; and he will make them to bear their iniquity with terrour: And they ſhall be convinced, that they have lyed againſt <hi>God,</hi> and ſhall be made to bear the guilt of ſuch ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſhall ſuffer the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall receive the doom of lyars.</p>
            <pb n="128" facs="tcp:152324:71"/>
            <p>Theſe are weighty Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to deter men from corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Word of God.</p>
            <p>There is another terrible Text to this purpoſe in the cloſe of all the Scripture:<note place="margin">Rev. 22.18.</note> 
               <hi>If any man ſhall adde unto theſe things, God ſhall adde unto him the plagues that are written in this Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee how the Word of God witneſſeth againſt all deviſed Will-worſhip, which is not Worſhip <hi>in truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſurely, if men did look at <hi>God</hi> as <hi>God,</hi> and look upon the Scriptures as his Word, owning the Soveraign Authority of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, they would then be fearful to corrupt the Worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>God</hi> in his Word doth ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prohibit, and ſo earneſtly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie againſt ſuch Corruption. But here is the miſchief, that howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver men may ſay that they believe the Scriptures to be the Word of <hi>God;</hi> yet they are indeed no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Infidels concerning the Scripture, and the Name of <hi>God</hi> in it.<note place="margin">Jer. 6.10</note> 
               <hi>The word of God is to them a reproach, they have no delight in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:152324:71"/>it.</hi> Men think that they have as good words as the Word of <hi>God</hi> is, and that they have Traditions which are of as great Authority as <hi>God's</hi> Revelations: Now when Scripture is ſlighted, ſo that it lays no awe upon mens ſpirits, no marvel that men follow their own inventions.</p>
            <p>Well, Beloved; Goſpel-worſhip is a Worſhip <hi>in truth,</hi> Regular wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which hath its foundation in the Word, and is ordered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word of <hi>God.</hi> VVe read in Scripture of <hi>pure Religion:</hi> certainly,<note place="margin">Jam. 1.21</note> that Religion is moſt pure which hath its foundation and dependence upon the VVord of God; and this Religion ſtands for ever, will ſtand in the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-day, when all other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will be condemned to Hell. The VVord of <hi>God</hi> endures for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ſo do they that conform themſelves to it.</p>
            <p>Now, for ſuch as ſlight Divine Inſtitutions, and caſt off the onely ſure Foundation, they make other Rules to themſelves, and ground
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:152324:72"/>their Worſhip upon other rotten Foundations. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The imagination of their own hearts: <hi>Me thinks,</hi> ſaith one and another, <hi>this is very good Worſhip, this is decent, and this is good order.</hi> But God often forbids the ſetting up of ſuch a Rule, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us, that we muſt not follow our own hearts, we muſt not go in the way which we our ſelves ſhall chooſe, we muſt not do what ſeems good in our own eyes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Men deſire to ſatisfie the fleſh, and therefore delight in a ſenſe-pleaſing worſhip. Thus the Papiſts have a Worſhip pompous, and outwardly glorious, meerly ſenſual, pleaſing their eyes with their goodly Images, (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet calls them) and with their coſtly Furniture; and pleaſing the ear with their Muſick, and the ſmelling, with incenſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes. All Worſhip of <hi>God</hi> is the exerciſe of Faith, and to draw out ſpiritual Meditations, not to pleaſe the ſenſes: That Worſhip which is moſt pleaſing to the fleſh, is to be ſuſpected as moſt diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="131" facs="tcp:152324:72"/>
            <p n="3">3. Antiquity is a great prop of falſe Worſhip, and traditions of Fathers are much pleaded by the Superſtitious: but what ſaith Chriſt? <hi>Call no man Father on earth;</hi> i. e. ſo as to relie on his Authority: and what ſaid <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an? Chriſt is Antiquity to me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas mihi Jeſus, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>and not Cuſtome; but Chriſt is the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Name of a Church goes very far with many. Thus the Papiſts will be bound up wholly by the Determinations and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the Church, whatever they be; and they cry out, <hi>What, will you go againſt the Church?</hi> and if you enquire what is the Church, it will be found to be nothing elſe but the will and reſolution of a proud Pope, or the Antichriſtian Prelacy.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> A. B.</note>
               <q>Indeed the Authority of a true Church, ſhining with Scripture-light muſt not be a Cypher, but it muſt not be all things.</q>
            </p>
            <p>VVell, Beloved; If we profeſs our ſelves Chriſtians, it greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth us to be well ſettled in the right foundation of religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:152324:73"/>that as touching what we do herein, we may be able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this Queſtion, <hi>Who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it?</hi> otherwiſe God and Chriſt will reject our Religion and Worſhip, as not being in <hi>Truth,</hi> not being <hi>Goſpel-worſhip;</hi> and it will be found an empty vain thing, by which we are no way advantaged, and for which there is no reward laid up.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Having inſerted ſome clear conſequences from the Doctrine, I come now in the ſecond place, to a Uſe of Inſtruction.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are here taught, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> of God doth principally conſiſt, <hi>viz.</hi> in the inward motions and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the heart; This is <hi>Spirit-worſhip;</hi> this is to worſhip God in <hi>Spirit;</hi> and Chriſt tells us here, that this is <hi>true Worſhip:</hi> He that doth not thus ſerve God with his Spirit, <hi>worſhipping</hi> him with the inward motions and affections of the heart, doth but mock God, in ſaying his Prayers, (as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:152324:73"/>phraſe it) and in coming to Church and hearing a Sermon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such a one deals with God, as the Poets fable, that <hi>Prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi> dealt with <hi>Jupiter,</hi> in giving him bones covered with skin, when all the meat was taken off.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Learn here, That as in God's VVorſhip, we muſt feel inward motions ſtirring, and the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons muſt be up; ſo theſe motions and affections muſt be ſpiritual, excited in us by the Spirit of <hi>God,</hi> or elſe we cannot truly be ſaid to worſhip God in Spirit. Now</p>
            <p n="1">1. This doth make againſt all unregenerate perſons or hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites that are not rerenewed by the Spirit of <hi>God;</hi> however they may feel ſometimes, ſome flaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of affection in their Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet theſe motions are not from the ſantifying Spirit of <hi>God,</hi> and ſo they are not true <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It makes againſt all Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous and Superſtitious <hi>Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers:</hi> commonly ſuch mens De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions are very dead; uſually falſe <hi>worſhip</hi> is groſly hypocritical:
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:152324:74"/>
               <hi>This people</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>draw near me with their mouth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa 29.13</note> 
               <hi>and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me:</hi> and why? <hi>Their fear toward me</hi> (<hi>i e.</hi> their <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>) <hi>is taught by the Precepts of men:</hi> Or if ſuch <hi>Worſhippers</hi> be not groſly hypocritical, yet there is a ſecret hypocrifie and want of ſpirituality in their <hi>Worſhip:</hi> The inward motions and affections of the heart, which they may feel ſtirring, are not Spiritual, but Carnal; ariſing from their own deceitful hearts. This is a ſure Rule,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> D. D.</note> ſaid an emiuent Divine; <hi>The Author of any Worſhip, is, in a manner, the performer of it:</hi> Now God his Spirit is not the Author of an Idolatrous or Superſtitious <hi>Worſhip,</hi> but Satan and Man's brain are the Authors of it; and ſurely the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> owes their inventions no ſuch Service, as to attend upon them, and help them in the performance of ſuch <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> Let them talk what they pleaſe, of the uſefulneſs of their Inventions, and Additaments, and deviſed Ceremonies, for
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:152324:74"/>working upon the affections, and to excite Devotion; The truth is, that only the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> excites true Devotion, and in doing this, he blows with his own bellowes; there is good ground therefore to ſupect that Devotion, which is ſtirred up by ſuch means as men talk of.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Learn here, that in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming any ſolemn Service to God, there muſt be a Conjunction of <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth:</hi> There muſt be a true matter of Worſhip groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Word of God; it muſt be no deviſed <hi>Worſhip:</hi> and there muſt be a true manner of <hi>Worſhip;</hi> it muſt be done with the very Spirit, and come from the heart; it muſt be no formal, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemental Worſhip; As one ſpeaks wittily, and alſo ſolidly,
<q>Though it muſt not be Will-worſhip, as oppoſed to preſcribed Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, (it muſt not be a Worſhip according to our own imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or humours, or wills) yet in regard of performance, it muſt be Will-worſhip; <hi>i. e.</hi> it muſt be performed with
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:152324:75"/>the Will and Affections.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the two common Errours in men's Worſhip: If there be <hi>Truth,</hi> ſo that it be a true Worſhip, for the matter of it, yet they worſhip not in <hi>Spirit;</hi> with a true heart and fervent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: Again, if there be <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> ſome blind kind of Zeal, ſome affections in the ſervice perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet there is no <hi>Truth;</hi> the Worſhip is like that of the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi> in Mount <hi>Gerizim,</hi> it wants the Truth of God's Word to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it: Thus ſome are <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> ſome <hi>Jewes;</hi> either a falſe Worſhip, or a true Worſhip with a falſe heart; there are few true <hi>worſhippers:</hi> You ſee here, that true <hi>Goſpel-worſhip,</hi> is a Worſhip in <hi>Spirit</hi> and in <hi>Truth.</hi>

            <p>Then we ſhall be ſure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in our way: For as the truth is the ſame, yeſterday, and to day, and for ever; ſo will the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-man be of the ſame mind, and the ſame frame, and the ſame practice in Religion; whereas they who build not upon this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will be like that <hi>Biſhop of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> who was called <hi>Euripus,</hi> becauſe of his ebbing and flowing, his going this way and that way in matters of Religion: For a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick</hi>

            <p>And, that you may enter into, and perſevere in, a right courſe of true Goſpel-worſhip, ſuch as is pleaſing to God;</p>

               <hi>CAESAR</hi>'s Right: OR, The Subject's Duty, Due Subjection. From <hi>Romanes</hi> 13.1.</head>
            <p>IN the beginning of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (in the firſt ſeven verſes) the Apoſtle aſſerteth the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right and Authority of <hi>Magistracy;</hi> and thereupon infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and thence preſſeth, the Duty of <hi>Subjection</hi> and Obedience to Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>It may not be amiſs to touch a little upon the Apoſtle's ſcope here, and the occaſion and ground of this Aſſertion and Vindication of the rightful Authority of Rulers;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:152324:81"/>and of ſuch earneſtneſs in preſſing Chriſtians to Subjection and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, not onely here, but elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where alſo more plainly.<note place="margin">Tit. 3.1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle had told theſe <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> that Believers <hi>are not under the Law;</hi> and he afterwards tells Chriſtians, that they muſt not be <hi>the ſervants of men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.23. Gal. 5.1.</note> and calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to <hi>ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made them free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Apoſtle foreſeeing, that ſome might abuſe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſtian liberty, to a denyal of all Superiority, and to the caſting off the Yoke of Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Obedience to ſuch as God hath ſet over them; (as now <hi>Libertines</hi> cry out, <hi>Liberty, liberty; Chriſt</hi> (ſay they) <hi>hath made us free, and we are not under the power of any, but Chriſt, He is our King.</hi>) The Apoſtle, I ſay, foreſeeing, that among ſuch as profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians, there might and would be unruly, Anti-Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Spirits, that would <hi>deſpiſe Dominions,</hi> and caſt off the Yoke of Subjection, doth therefore clean
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:152324:81"/>up this point, teaching that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity doth not conſume, but confirm civil polity. He urgeth Subjection upon Chriſtians, all Chriſtians, <hi>every ſoul,</hi> ſhewing the equity and neceſſity of it; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the better Chriſtian any man is, the better Subject will he be: He that hath no Religion, may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey in ſome things for fear, or for ſome other reſpects, &amp; from ſome ſorry principles; but if a man be Religious, a Chriſtian indeed, he will be ſubject and obedient for Conſcience ſake, in all things that may be done by him with a good Conſcience. The Goſpel doth not deſtroy, but eſtabliſh Civil Government.</p>

            <p>Briefly now, thus take the meaning of the <hi>Attribute:</hi> God is the Author of Magiſtracy; it is the Will and Appointment of God, that there ſhould be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Governours; <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities</hi> and <hi>Powers;</hi> ſo that all Rulers and Governours are either <hi>Miſſi,</hi> or <hi>Permiſſi,</hi> by <hi>Comiſſion,</hi> or <hi>Permiſſion</hi> from God.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Proof. </seg>
               </label> Now I come to the proof of the point:</p>
            <p>The Text is full of this Doctrine; it is here a plain Propoſition, and it is ſtrongly implied in the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Duty here urged, as you ſhall ſee further by and by; but other Scriptures prove this fully:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.14. Dan 2.21 Dan. 4.32</note> 
               <hi>Governours</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>ſent of God: God ſetteth up Kings: The moſt high ruleth in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of men, and giveth it to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he will.</hi> Chriſt, the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Wiſdom of his Father, tells us,<note place="margin">Pro. 8.15</note> That <hi>by him Kings Reign:</hi> God in one Pſalm ſpeaking to Princes, and Magiſtrates,<note place="margin">Pſ. 82.6.</note> ſaith, <hi>I have ſaid ye are Gods.</hi> I who have power to appoint whom I will to be my Vicegerents, do call you, and conſtitute you, to be my Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon Earth: Magiſtrates are called <hi>Gods,</hi>

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:152324:87"/>and authorized by him, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe power among men; <hi>I have ſaid, ye are Gods:</hi> I have given you a Command, Commiſſion, and Power to bear Rule; and my Word is a ſufficient warrant for any Office or Ordinance: Thus the point is proved; it ſhall now be very briefly Demonſtrated.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Divine Authority of Magiſtracy,<note place="margin">Demonst.</note> (that it is God's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance) may be argued from the antiquity of it: We read in the Book of God, of Magiſtrates, even from the beginning; and why may we not uſe the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to prove the Divine Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Magiſtracy, which is wont to be uſed (and that not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aptly) to prove the Divinity of Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſtrange pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of it thorow ſo many Ages, in ſo many Changes and Revolutions, amidſt all Wars and Confuſions, againſt the rage of men and Devils: God hath owned it as a Plant of his own ſetting, which he planted early, and would never ſuffer to be rooted up.</p>
            <pb n="160" facs="tcp:152324:88"/>
            <p n="2">2. The Divine Ordination of Magiſtracy, may be argued from the injunctions laid by God upon Magiſtrates, with his preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Rules of Government:<note place="margin">Deut. 1.17. Jer. 22.3. Pſal. 2.10</note> If they had no Authority to Rule, why ſhould God command them to Rule according to his Lawes? and preſcrite to them Rules of Government? herein God owns Magiſtracy and Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We are commanded to pray for Magiſtrates;<note place="margin">Tit. 3.1.</note> therefore Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy is ordained by God, and approved of God; otherwiſe, if the Office were evil, and without Divine allowance, we ſhould pray againſt it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God his commanding of Subjects to obey Magiſtrates, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth Magiſtracy to be of God: The enjoyning of duty to the Subjects, eſtabliſheth the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Rulers.</p>
            <p>I might adde ſeveral other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, to demonſtrate the truth of this Aſſertion,
[That Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy is of Divine authority, is God's Ordinance] but enough
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:152324:88"/>hath been ſaid to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſtay to conſider and Anſwer the many objections, that are urged againſt this Truth: but I ſhall onely take notice of two, and hint a very ſhort Anſwer.</p>

               </label> 1. The unlawfulneſs of Kingly Government cannot be inferred hence; for God was not angry with them, ſimply for asking a King, but becauſe they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately bent upon it, to have a King, out of an affection of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, being weary of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to them, and eſtabliſhed among them, and being deſirous to be like the reſt of the Nations, the Heathens and Idolaters round about them; and becauſe they would needs have a King, out of ambition, and out of a carnal, vain, ſinful confidence in a King, as able to protect them; and out of diffidence in God, as though he could not defend them in his own way; and God was angry with them for their ingratitude toward good <hi>Samuel,</hi> who had

            <p n="2">2. God himſelf choſe <hi>Saul</hi> to be King, and qualified him for the Office, and commanded <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> to anoint him; which he would not have done, if the Kingly Office had been diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God.</p>

            <pb n="164" facs="tcp:152324:90"/>

            <p>We muſt obſerve and perform their commands in all things poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:152324:100"/>and lawful to be done by us; the onely limitation of our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is this, <hi>In the Lord:</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the higher Powers command, ſo that we do not apprehend their Commands as croſſing Gods Commands, all Subjects muſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey: for as ſoon as Soveraign Authority hath commanded any thing that is lawful, warranted or allowed by the Word of God, God his ſtamp is ſet upon that Command. We muſt not look upon the things commanded, (further than to enquire into the lawfulneſs of them) but upon God's Ordination, ſetting Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates in place to command, and Subjects in place for obedience: So far as the Magiſtrate hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to command, that is, <hi>in the Lord,</hi> and according to God; ſo far there is a neceſſity of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not onely for fear, but for Conſcience ſake; [becauſe God commandeth every ſoul to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Higher Powers, ſo far, as that we caſt not off our ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to him, who is the higheſt
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:152324:101"/>Potentate, and ſupreme Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. But when the Laws of men croſs the Laws of God, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Injunctions are contrary to Divine Preſcriptions; here now we muſt obey God rather then man; we muſt ſo give to <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which is due to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as that we rob not God of his due. A Magiſtrate cannot be enriched with the ſpoyls of God; nor is it any diſhonour to an earthly King, to ſee the KING of Kings ſerved before him. Nor is the Subject bound to obey in all things, but onely ſo far as may ſtand with his Allegiance and Duty to God, and ſo far as he may go, and not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour God, or wrong his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. It is good for us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve both the Connexion and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of thoſe two Commands,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.17.</note> 
               <hi>Fear God, and, Honour the King:</hi> VVe muſt ſo honour the King, as that withal we fear God; and muſt be ſure, that in obeying Man, we do not diſobey God: and this <hi>[Fear God.]</hi> goes before that <hi>[Honour the King.]</hi> We may and muſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the hard Commands of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:152324:101"/>but we muſt not obey their ſinful Commands, (if any ſuch at any time be.) The <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> ſmarted ſorely for worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Golden Calves, in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the command of <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> their King; and we find that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Midwives are commended and rewarded for diſobeying the wicked command of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> they could not do what he did enjoyn them, becauſe they feared God. They are ill friends to the Magiſtrate, and to themſelves, to their own ſouls, who perſwade the Magiſtrate to enjoyn any thing to his Subjects which the Word of God doth not allow; or that are ready for their own baſe ends to obey his finful Commands. Indeed God is to be obeyed without any diſpute, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, or helitancie,<note place="margin">Solo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitu vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatis Divinae.</note> 
               <hi>upon a bare ſight of his will,</hi> as the Schoolmen ſpeak: but I muſt compare mens Commands with God's Laws, and if I find a diſſonancie to the Laws of God, I muſt be diſobedient, (or I ſhould rather ſay, non-obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:152324:102"/>for it is not properly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, not to obey men againſt God.) I have met with a pretty Expoſition of, and Comment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that of the Preacher;<note place="margin">Eccl. 8.2.</note> 
               <hi>I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel thee to keep the King's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that in regard of the Oath of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Theſe latter words may be look'd upon as a reaſon or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of the Exhortation: It is neceſſary to give obedience to Magiſtrates, not onely out of fear toward them, becauſe they bear the ſword; but eſpecially out of Conſcience toward God, becauſe his Vows are upon us. Here ſeems to be a reference to ſome Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Oath of Allegiance and Fidelity, taken by the people, bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to their Prince. (In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Oaths to Magiſtrates are to be kept, and ſurely Oaths to God are not to be broken, but religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerved.) But now</p>
            <p>Secondly, Theſe words, <hi>In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Oath of God,</hi> may be looked upon as a limitation to the precedent Exhortation. Keep the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:152324:102"/>King's Command, but with regard had to the Oath of God, ſo that there be no violation of that, ſo that your Obedience to the King be conſiſtent with your Fidelity to God. Our Obedience to man muſt be regulated by a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience toward God.</p>
            <p>This is Orthodox Doctrine, owned by all ſound honeſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, though there may be (as there have been) ſome Court-Claw-backs that may put forth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtuff.</p>
            <p>It was a notable reſolution, and a noble ſpeech of thoſe Worthies, who were commanded by the King to worſhip the Image which he had ſet up: they ſaid unto the King, <hi>O Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 3.16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>we are not careful to anſwer thee in this, &amp;c.</hi> They ſubmitted to the fire when they could not act as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; ſo we muſt yield paſſive obedience, when we cannot with a good Conſcience yield active; we muſt chooſe rather to ſuffer than to ſin: and when a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſubmits himſelf to the penalty
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:152324:103"/>of not doing that which is againſt his Conſcience, this is no Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion or reſiſtance of the Powers, but here is ſtill a ſubjection to them; though this is the loud Outcry of many ignorant and malicious perſons, againſt conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious Miniſters, and private Chriſtians, that cannot readily conſent to do all that men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them; <hi>O Rebellion, Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion! O Rebels, Rebels!</hi> The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of famous and bleſſed memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in thoſe ſad <hi>Marian Days,</hi> did not reſiſt, nor rebel, they willingly and cheerfully yeilded their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the flames, but ſtill they profeſſed and proteſted againſt the Idolatrous Doctrine and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip then eſtabliſhed by Law.</p>
            <p>And now, for a further opening and a clearer ſtating of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in queſtion, <hi>viz.
[Wherein, and how far we are bound to obey Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,]</hi> I propound to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, Whether the Magiſtrate command us to do that which is unlawful, or deal hardly with us,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:152324:103"/>by laying upon us unjuſtly ſome heavy burden, (for theſe are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent caſes.) Well then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In caſe of commanding any unlawful action; to ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand we muſt deny our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; the ſupreme Power of all is to be obeyed: no power on earth can ſecure the Conſcience in doing that which is unlawful, and croſs to the Rule of God's Word. But</p>
            <p>Secondly: If the higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhall,<note place="margin">Multum eſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminis inter eos, qui vim injuſtam patienter rolerant, &amp; eos, qui quod injuſtum eſt ſaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt. <hi>Sze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</hi>
               </note> contrary to the Laws by which they are to Rule, lay heavy burdens upon us, whereby we ſhall ſuffer in our perſons or Eſtates, in ſuch a caſe we muſt labour with patience to endure, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to act to our own prejudice that which cannot honeſtly be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided or put off.</p>
            <p>Now to clear both theſe Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I ſhall ſpeak a little to a Scripture-inſtance or two, about which there maybe ſome enquiry, not without ground.</p>
            <p>The Inſtances are of Subjects their obedience and diſobedience

            <p n="3">3. We muſt obey in ſingleneſs of heart, in the fear of the Lord, for Conſcience ſake, and not being led by our own intereſts and hopes of advantaging our ſelves in the world.

            <p>This is Chriſtian Obedience, to perform civil duties upon grounds of Religion, &amp; within the bounds of Religion and Conſcience; and this is a main thing to be lookt to, in our obedience to men, to have a Conſcience therein toward God, and to ſerve the Lord Chriſt, to whom we muſt give account, and by whom we ſhall be reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our obedience and ſervice to men, which is done as unto him.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Then I ſhall conclude ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing poſitively concerning this matter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is Conſcience?</p>
            <p>The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is compounded of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the Latine word <hi>Conſciencia,</hi> of <hi>Con</hi> and <hi>Scire:</hi> now <hi>Conſcire</hi> is, <hi>to know together;</hi> ſo that <hi>Conſcientia</hi> ſounds as much as <hi>Scientia cum alio.</hi> Well then, Conſcience is a knowledge, and inward ſenſe of our own judgement, and of the judgement of another, <hi>viz.</hi> of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:152324:108"/>God, either approving our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as good, or condemning them as evil.</p>
            <p>Now Conſcience is either good or evil.</p>
            <p>A good Conſcience is a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and perſwaſion of the Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Regularity of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of the approbation of God and of men that judge right.</p>
            <p>An evil Conſcience is a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and apprehenſion of the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legality and Irregularity of our actions, for which our own hearts condemn us, ſo that we fear the judgement of God or Man for our evil deeds.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
               </label> Now, the Queſtion is, <hi>Whether Humane Laws do bind in Conſcience, ſo, that the violation of them makes an evil Conſcience?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
               </label> In order to the Solution of this, here is to be conſidered, how Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience refers to God, and how to Men.</p>
            <p>Strictly, Conſcience is referred onely to God: ſo that an evil Conſcience is a ſenſe of ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt God, and a fear
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:152324:108"/>of God's judgement for it.</p>
            <p>More largely, Conſcience bears reſpect alſo to men: thus the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, that <hi>herein he did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe himſelf,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 24, 16.</note> 
               <hi>to have a Conſcience void of offence toward God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward men;</hi> being careful to avoid offences againſt either Table of the Law, both in general and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: ſo that an evil Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is a ſenſe of ſin, as againſt God, ſo againſt men; and a fear, as of being judged for it by God, ſo of being cenſured by men, or of falling under diſgrace.</p>
            <p>So much as to the firſt ſpecial enquiry, in order to the Solution of the main Queſtion: I have ſhewed you, what Conſcience is; a good Conſcience, and an evil Conſcience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What is it to bind the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or to be bound in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience?</p>
            <p>This is to be underſtood, either <hi>ſtrictly,</hi> or more <hi>largely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Strictly</hi> and properly, There is an Obligation to Obedience, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a fear of offending God, or
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:152324:109"/>under the danger of a moral ſault.</p>
            <p>More <hi>largely</hi> and improperly; there is an obligation upon the Conſcience, under a fear of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending men, or under the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger only of a civil offence, which is a matter of ill report among men.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion is properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the obligation of the Conſcience, as Conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth God: So that the doing, or not doing, of a thing, brings on a moral culpableneſs, with which a man's heart may charge him, a ſin againſt God. Well then</p>
            <p n="3">3. How many wayes is this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation in Conſcience, induced, with reſpect to the Laws of man?</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Conſcience is bound, either onely in general; <hi>i. e.</hi> by vertue of God's general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to honour Superiours; or alſo in ſpecial; <hi>i. e.</hi> with reſpect to ſingular, or poſitive Laws of Superiours.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſpecial Law or Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the civil <hi>Powers,</hi> may be ſaid to bind the Conſcience, either
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:152324:109"/>
               <hi>per ſe,</hi> or <hi>per accidens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A civil Conſtitution or Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is obligatory <hi>per ſe,</hi> when it ſo binds the Conſcience, that it muſt neceſſarily be obſerved, and cannot be croſſed or neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without offending God; and that by reaſon of the ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the <hi>Powers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Sometimes ſuch a Law or Sanction is obligatory, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Conſcience only by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as when any thing is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded with reſpect to good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the keeping of a due <hi>decorum,</hi> and the avoiding of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal: The Conſcience is bound by this Command, ſo far as the violation of it, is the deſtruction of good order, and a breach of the publick peace, and matter of ſcandal, or an occaſion of ſinning unto others.</p>
            <p>A very learned and Orthodox Writer, hath theſe diſtinctions, among others, in the diſcuſſion of this great queſtion, which we are now in hand with.</p>
            <p>Well,<note place="margin">Determ.</note> now to conclude ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:152324:110"/>in Anſwer to this Inquiry; Whether humane Laws, or the Commands of men, do bind the Conſcience?</p>
            <p>Concerning which, I lay down this in General.</p>
            <p>Humane Laws do, and do not, bind the Conſcience: For the underſtanding of this, we muſt, with <hi>Aquinas,</hi> diſtinguiſh of Laws; he tells us, That <hi>Laws</hi> of humane Poſition, or Sanction, are either <hi>Righteous</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous;</hi> and thus he concludes,<note place="margin">Juſtae leges hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manae obligant, in ſoro Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis aternae, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>The righteous Laws of men, have a binding power in the Conſcience, as they are</hi> groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon, <hi>derived from,</hi> and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abe to <hi>the Eternal Law, the Law of God,</hi> and no further; for only God's Laws do ſimply and <hi>per ſe;</hi> bind the Conſcience; <hi>But unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Laws</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>bind not in the Court of Conſcience,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leges autem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>injuſtae, non obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>unleſs in ſome caſes; as for the avoiding of ſcandal, and with reſpect to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick peace,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yea,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>f thoſe Laws of men be unrighteous; per contrarietatem ad bonum Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, as contrary to Divine good, or
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:152324:110"/>the Law of God,</hi> (as if Rulers ſhould make Laws binding to an Idolatrous Profeſſion or Worſhip, or to any thing contrary to the Law of God,) <hi>We are bound in Conſcience not to obey ſuch Laws; it is meet that we ſhould obey God rather than men:</hi> And in another place he hath this concluſion;<note place="margin">2da 2dae; qu. 104. Art. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Subditi in iis tantummodo Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus ſuis obedire tenentur, in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ipſi Superioribus ſubjiciuntur, &amp; in quibus ipſi Superiores ſublimioris potestatis praecepto non adverſantur.</hi> This in General.</p>
            <p>Particularly; for a full deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Queſtion, there might be many diſtinct conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions laid down, according to the diverſe diſtinctions of Perſons or Powers that make Laws, or give Commands, with reſpect to the diverſity of the Subject, about which they are, as relating to the matters Civil or Eccleſiaſtical: but I ſhall adde only a few words,
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Negatively,</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Affirmatively.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Negatively,</hi> I lay down theſe three Poſitions.</p>
            <pb n="206" facs="tcp:152324:111"/>
            <p n="1">1. Mens commands oblige not the Conſcience directly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, as God's Commands do, but by the intervention of God's Command. It is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God that binds my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to obſerve any command of man: <hi>Submit your ſelves to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Ordinance of man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Eccleſ. 8.10.</note> 
               <hi>for the Lord's ſake,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter: Keep the Kings Commandment, and that in regard of the Oath of God: i. e.</hi> not onely for fear of man, but alſo and chiefly, for fear of wronging thy Conſeience toward God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Humane Laws bind not the Conſcience univerſally and unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitedly, as the Laws of God do: I muſt examine the conſtitutions of men, by the Laws of God, and ſee whether they be righteous or no, whether they be not contrary to God's Law; and if I find them ſo, I am bound in Conſcience, to deny active obedience.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Commands of men do not bind abſolutely, as the Laws of God do: There may be a due
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:152324:111"/>ſubjection in ſome caſes unto man, by ſuffering the penalty, though obedience be withholden.</p>
            <p>The reſult of all, is this, That no voice, but the Voice of God, muſt be heard in the Conſcience, as commanding there, and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indiſpenſibly to obedience: and let me add this, That it is antichriſtian for men to ſet up their own Will as a rule of ſin and duty, to take it upon them to give Laws to the Conſcience. This is St. <hi>Paul</hi> his Character of Antichriſt, that <hi>he as God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.4.</note> 
               <hi>ſitteth in the Temple of God; i. e.</hi> in the Church: he ſitteth as God; <hi>i. e.</hi> (ſaith <hi>Diodate</hi>) making himſelf abſolute Lord of Conſciences, bringing them to his obedience. The ſetting up of another Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver then Chriſt, is properly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtianiſm. What ſaith <hi>Calvin?</hi>
               <q>As long as the Pope exerciſeth Tyranny over the Conſcience, we ſhall not ceaſe to call him Antichriſt: nay, we ſhall go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaith he, and call them members of Antichriſt, who
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:152324:112"/>take ſuch ſnares upon their Conſciences.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Affirmatively,</hi> and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, concerning this queſtion of the binding power of humane Laws in the Conſcience, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thus:</p>
            <p>That all Laws and Commands of men in Power, to which the order of the Power doth right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and duly extend it ſelf, are to be obeyed for Conſcience ſake; and all ſuch conſtitutions of men, as are fundamentally, or redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, and interpretatively the Commands of God, or which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn that which hath allowance from the Word of God; all ſuch have a binding power in the Court of Conſcience; not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and immediately indeed upon account of man's ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as they are humane Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but as they are God his Laws, propounded and enforced by a civil ſanction; and as they fall in duty, under that general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of obeying thoſe that are over us in the Lord.</p>

               <hi>ſhall receive judgment to themſelves:</hi> And this expreſſion, is by the way, a little to be noted, as hinting to us three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The folly of thoſe that are oppoſite to God's Order, in his Conſtitution of humane <hi>powers,</hi> refractory, and diſobedient to the good Laws, and juſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, of Magiſtrates; they run themſelves upon miſcheif; they are enemies to themſelves: when they ſuffer the penalty of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, they have but their own ſeeking; they do (as it were) reach out the hand for it, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. Now, will any wiſe man wilfully hurt himſelf?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is hinted the Juſtice of the Laws, in inflicting the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Tranſgreſſion upon wilful
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:152324:116"/>Offenders; whatever the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of good Laws do ſuffer accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Law, is to be imputed to their own wickedneſs; they have nothing to lay to the charge o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Magiſtrates: They that reſiſt the <hi>powers,</hi> receive <hi>judgment</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: their due is paid them; their puniſhment is but a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, the reward of their offence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Here is a hint of the vanity, and bootleſſneſs of ſuch attempt of Rebellious people, againſt God's Ordinance; when they riſe up againſt Authority, againſt the <hi>Powers</hi> which God hath ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> up, <hi>They receive judgment to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:</hi> They have the worſt of it; like a man that runs his head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a wall, to beat down the wall; he breaks his own head, it may be beats out his own brains, but cannot overthrow the wall, nor do it any harm: <hi>They that reſist, ſhall receive judgment:</hi> And this pernicious effect, or fruit of diſobedience, (which is a denial of ſubjection to Magiſtrates) is
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:152324:116"/>confirmed by one great end of the Inſtitution of Magiſtracy, of God his committing the power of the Sword to the Magiſtrate: namely, That he might be <note place="margin">Ver.3. </note>
               <hi>a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to evil doers; for Rulers are not a terrour to good works, but to the evil:</hi> Here is the effect, put for the cauſe; <hi>evil works,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Metalep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</note> for <hi>evil workers:</hi> And the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth himſelf in this manner; becauſe, according to the courſe of Juſtice, men are not to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed but for evil works; for ſomething that is contrary to the Law of God, and to the Laws of man conſonant thereunto, and grounded thereupon. Note this, Subjects are not to be threatened, nor flattered into obedience to thoſe Commands of the Powers, which are ſinful, and repugnant to the Law of God, and a good Conſcience; or to thoſe that are arbitrary, and illegal, contrary to, or beſide the laudable conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Government, which is to be managed according to known Laws; nor ought men to be puniſhed for not obeying in
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:152324:117"/>ſuch caſes. The Magiſtrate in all his Commands, as well as his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions, ſhould act as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of God, urging onely what God would have urged, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing accordingly:<note place="margin">Prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gati, nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la eſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtas.</note> So that none of theſe arguments for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to Magiſtrates are preſſed; nor is any thing in this diſcourſe held forth, to abet or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſuch an antichriſtian, and diſingenuous maxime; <hi>That Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are bound to yield abſolute obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Supericurs;</hi> (as ſome atheiſtically and abſurdly conceit, or do diſſemblingly and diſhoneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for their own ends, profeſſe themſelves to be of this Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or at leaſt, are of ſuch practice, as if they did judg them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged, to obey all the commands of their Superiours, though againſt Conſcience) nor can any thing that hath been ſaid, (for ought I can ſee) be honeſtly or rationally interpreted, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting at all upon thoſe, who do not, (becauſe they dare not) in ſome caſes yield active obedience; <hi>viz.</hi> in that which ſeemeth to

            <p>Well, This is a third ground of the point, or a third Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to enforce the duty of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to Magiſtrates; becauſe they that will not be ſubject, but reſiſt the Powers, ſhall receive to themſelves judgement, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the Magiſtrate being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God, to be a terrour to <hi>evil works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Here is a fourth Argument,<note place="margin">4 <hi>Arg.</hi> ab utili.</note> taken <hi>ab utili,</hi> from the profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effect and fruit of due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Magiſtrate: It is good for us to do that which will turn to our praiſe. But now, to obey the <hi>powers</hi> ordained of God, will turn to our praiſe: It is therefore good for us to obey the powers: <hi>Do that which is good:</hi> i. e. hold faſt Innocency, and do vertuouſly, in conformity to good Laws, <hi>and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the power:</hi> This <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, praiſe,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:152324:118"/>ſignifies here approbation, and remuneration; if thou beeſt an obedient ſubject, thou ſhalt be approved of, and rewarded by, the Magiſtrate. Thus Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours are ſaid to be ſent for the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of evil doers, and the <hi>praiſe</hi> of them that do well:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.14.</note> and ſo this word is to be interpreted in that ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>Then ſhall every man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.5.</note> (<hi>i. e.</hi> every godly man, every faithful man) <hi>have praiſe of God.</hi> The Lord Chriſt, the Judge, ſhall in that day give publick Teſtimony to his innocency, and give him the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward promiſed. Note this by the way, This ſhould bear up, and quiet the Spirits of Chriſt his faithful Servants, when they are reproached by men, and reviled as Hereticks, and Seditious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or Phanatiques, or Rebels, and caſt out, and injuriouſly dealt with. Let them commit their cauſe to Chriſt their Judge, of whom they ſhall have praiſe and glory.</p>
            <p>Well; honeſt, vertuous, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious, obedient Subjects, ſhall
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:152324:118"/>loſe nothing by it, but ſhall reap the benefit of innocency, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and due obedience in the Lord; they ſhall be commended and rewarded for it by the good Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>And this Argument for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and obedience, is fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an intimation of this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial end of Magiſtracy, and duty of the Magiſtrate; <hi>For he is the Minister of God to thee for good:</hi> If thou doſt that which is good, behaving thy ſelf orderly, in a conformity to good Laws, then he is the Miniſter or ſervant of God, appointed and impowered to countenance and reward thee.</p>
            <p n="5">5.<note place="margin">5 <hi>Arg.</hi> a devito.</note> Now there is in theſe very words, an Argument for ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>i. e.</hi> reverence and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Magiſtrates. The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is in his place God's ſervant for the Subject's profit, for the advantage of God's people: This is the end of God his Ordinance, <hi>Magiſtracy;</hi> and this is the duty of God his Officer, the <hi>Magiſtrate:</hi> and this is the care and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of good Magiſtrates, to make
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:152324:119"/>good this end of their Office and Power, improving it for the good of their Subjects: Rulers and Magiſtrates, are the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of God to us for good; for good natural, and moral, and civil, and ſpiritual, to preſere our lives, and liberties, and to ſecure to us that which we do rightfully poſſeſs and enjoy, to repreſs vilence, and defend us from the malice, and oppreſſion, and rapine, and cruely of unreaſonabe, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and licentious men; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain vice and wickedneſs, and to encourage and promote Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Piety, and to maintaine true Religion, and the purity of Doctrine and Worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Rulers are ſet over us by God, to care for us in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that under them we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty. Oh, what a bleſſing is a Vertuous and Religious King, from whom, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God,<note n="*" place="margin">Nutrix Eccleſiae, Pater Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triae.</note> his Subjects receive the benefit of Religion and Juſtice, who is the Church's Nurſe, and the Common-wealth's Father?
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:152324:119"/>O what a benefit is it, to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Pious, Righteous, ſettled Government? ſuch a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, (as one ſaith) like <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar's</hi> Tree, whoſe leaves are fair, and fruit much; afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meat, and ſhadow, and ſweet reſt.</p>
            <p>Now, is there not upon account of all this, a juſt challenge of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, <hi>i. e.</hi> reverence and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to <hi>Magiſtrates?</hi> Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts from them, and enjoyments by means of them, call upon us, to be ſubject to them.

            </p>
            <p>Now, <hi>Tribute</hi> is that which is charged upon, and paid out of a man's poſſeſſion and eſtate.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Honour,</hi> is a <hi>due inward affection</hi> toward him, whom we judg wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of reverence and reſpect, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his vertue, or for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency of his place; or for his beneficence toward us, or upon ſome other juſt conſideration; and an <hi>outward, due ſignification,</hi> and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of our inward reverence and reſpect toward him: <hi>honour</hi> is due to the <hi>powers,</hi> eſpecially the higher <hi>powers,</hi> becauſe of their Office and Place, as to our civil

            <p>Thus I have diſpatched the Doctrinal part of this my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There is another falſe, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, idle, Doctrine of theirs, hereby confuted; <hi>viz.</hi> this, <hi>That the Pope, and his Biſhops and Clergy</hi> (who call themſelves Spiritual) <hi>are exempted from ſubjection to civil Magistrates, both as to their perſons in the tryal of Eccleſiastical, Civil, and Criminal Cauſes; and as to their purſes and poſſeſſions, in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tributes.</hi> Whereas the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here chargeth every Soul to be ſubject to the <hi>higher powers,</hi> to the powers ordained of God; and Chriſt (we read) paid tribute for himſelf and <hi>Peter;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 25.11.</note> and <hi>Paul</hi> pleaded before the civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate: and we know that <hi>Aaron</hi> the high Prieſt, was ſubject to <hi>Moſes</hi> the chief Magiſtrate: yet

            <p>Secondly, Our Text and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſerves for Confutation of <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and <hi>Millenaries,</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> and ſome <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> who look for the aboliſhing of all Magiſtracy; that Chriſt alone may reign among the Saints, who cry down Magiſtrates, and deny that they have any coercive punitive Power; that cry up an equality and parity among Chriſtians; holding that Chriſtians need no Magiſtrates, and that they need not be ſubject to any.</p>
            <p>And why ſo? What do they plead for this opinion of theirs, and for their denial of ſubjection; <hi>i. e.</hi> reverence and obedience to Magiſtrates?</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>They ſay that they are the Lord his Freemen, and that it is againſt Chriſtian liberty, for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to be under the power of any, but Chriſt, who is their only King, who hath made them free; and that
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:152324:124"/>they must not be the ſervants of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Liberty unto which Chriſt doth free his people in this life, is inward and ſpiritual: Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel liberty is a liberty from ſin, a liberty unto duty; a liberty to ſerve God in our order, place and ſtation; a liberty from the yoke of Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſurely civil ſubjection to Superiours, is not inconſiſtent with ſuch ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual liberty. Indeed the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> diſcourſeth largely of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberty, and yet he doth more than once enjoyn, and earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly preſs ſubjection to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates. There is a wide differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt that liberty which Chriſt hath purchaſed for us, and that libertiniſm which Fanatical ſpirits plead for.</p>
            <p>And as to that other Text which they urge;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.23.</note> 
               <hi>Ye are bought with a price, be ye not the ſervants of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I Anſwer; that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, there ſpeaking of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of Servants to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, forbiddeth ſinful ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:152324:124"/>and not civil ſubjection.</p>
            <p>By <hi>[Servants of men]</hi> he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not thoſe that do civil ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to their Superiours; (he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids not Chriſtians thus to be ſervants) but he ſpeaks of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to gratifie their finful deſires, and a readineſs to obey their wicked Commands; for ſervants were then forced by threatnings and ſtrips, and by the terrours of death, to obey all the Commands of their unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maſters, were they never ſo diſhoneſt and wicked: therefore the Apoſtle gives this admonition to believing Servants, that were under the power of ſuch Maſters, to take heed, that they be not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified into wickedneſs; that they ſo ſerve men, as not to offend God, and wrong their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences: Thus <hi>Pareus</hi> interprets the place; and ſo <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi>

            <p>Well, here is the point; They whom Chriſt makes <hi>free, are free indeed;</hi> but it is from bondage to their own and other mens luſts, not from obedience to the honeſt Commands, and righteous Laws, of their Superiours.</p>
            <p>Divers other frivolous objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and abſurd pleas there are, which have been fully anſwered, over and over again, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers are in Print.</p>

            <p>Obj. <hi>And whereas it is alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; That Chriſt is the Chriſtians only King, therefore Chriſtians muſt be ſubject only to Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> The Anſwer is, That though Chriſt be the ſole King of the Church, yet he is not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly King in the Church; nor is his Kingdom contradictory to, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of, civil Powers and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: <hi>Subordinata non pug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi> There is no repugnancy, where there is a ſubordination: Kings in the Church, ſerve Chriſt the great King of the Church; and Chriſt keepeth up Order, and maintaineth Government in the Common-wealth for his Church's ſake; for his own <hi>Kingdom's</hi> ſake.</p>
            <p>I ſhall go no further in this Uſe of Confutation; nor ſhall I ſtay much longer in the Application of the point, only I ſhall add one

            <p>Indeed this is the common ſlaunder raiſed by the Devil and his Inſtruments, againſt Chriſt and his Kingdom, and Servants; as if the true Religion, and Profeſſors of it, were moſt dangerous to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil States; as if the beſt men, were the worſt Subjects; as if thoſe that are moſt Religious, were worſt to be truſted; as if there were moſt need to watch them, and keep them under.

               <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and a mover of Sedition? was it not laid to <hi>Paul</hi> his charge, once and again, that he was a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent fellow, and a mover of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and a Sect-maſter? And thus Popiſh, and profane, and Atheiſtical, malignant Spirits, have been alwayes ready to caſt ſuch aſperſions upon ſincere Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of the Goſpel; upon the moſt Religious, and Conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and faithful Miniſters and people.
<q>Oh! they are Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Fanatical; they are troublers of the Church and State, they have a Spirit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in them, it is not fit they ſhould live.</q> Thus the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil would ſcare men from embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Truth, and the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt, and from all forwardneſs in profeſſing Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But doubtleſs the godly Preachers, and ſincere profeſſors of the Goſpel, are ſo far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the right of Princes, and from a Spirit of Rebellion, as that the Doctrine which they bring, and which they entertaine, and deſire to hold faſt, eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:152324:127"/>the power of Rulers in their hands: They are, as one ſaith, like <hi>Solomon</hi> his Workmen that built the Temple, and built the Kings's Throne too. And ſurely, the more that any man takes in the Principles of the Goſpel, and of a Chriſtian, and the more power Religion hath upon his heart, the better Subject will he be. The Goſpel commandeth all lawful o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, even to Infidel Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates; ſuch as were when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans;</hi> and the more that the Doctrine of the Goſpel comes in power up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heart, the more and better obedience there will be.</p>
            <p>Rulers have no better friends, than ſuch as make Conſcience of their wayes: they are the beſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to Princes on earth, that do truly fear the God of Heaven. Theſe pray for Rulers, while o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do Curſe and Swear, and drink Healths (as they call them) thus conſtantly breaking the <hi>Kings</hi> Laws, and, by their wickedneſs, provoking God to bring Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon King and people.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:152324:127"/>Theſe that fear God, obey for Conſcience ſake, and ſo as to keep a good Conſcience, when others obey onely for fear, or according to their humour, and without Conſcience; and however ſuch talk of Loyalty, and boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the only Loyaliſts; it would, I think, be no hard matter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that none can be truly and certainly Loyal, but ſuch as are truly religious. They that do not truly fear God, do not truly Honour the King: Though they may flatter Rulers for their own ends, and be ready to ſerve them in many things, ſo farre as they may ſerve themſelves upon them, and carry on their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, and in thoſe matters that may ſuit with their own humors; yet to ſerve their luſts or intereſts, they will break the King's Laws, as well as God's; but ſhew me a good Chriſtian, and I will ſhew you a good Subject, that obeys for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake: he that truly fears God, will be afraid to break the Laws of God and Man.</p>
            <pb n="240" facs="tcp:152324:128"/>
            <p>And now there is an inference of the Magiſtrate's concernment, depending hereupon, and iſſuing from hence: If true Religion make good Subjects, and true Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety be the ſureſt ground and bond of Loyalty; then it greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Chriſtian Rulers to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and keep up the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among their Subjects, and to promote Piety, and to protect, countenance, and encourage thoſe that are truly religious and pious: This will prove to be a true point of State Policy; for it is matter of life or death political to any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as it doth well or ill under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it's own Intereſt: Now I ſay, This is the great concernment and intereſt of Soveraignty,<note place="margin">Qui vere civilis eſt vult cives bonos ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficere, &amp; legibus obtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perantes <hi>Ariſt. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Eth. c.</hi> 13</note> and ruling Authority, to take the moſt effectual courſe for the making of good Subjects; and that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly this, to take order, that principles of Religion may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled into <hi>men,</hi> and fixed in them, and that the power of godlineſſe may be promoted; and to this end, that the exerciſes of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:152324:128"/>both publick and private, may be encouraged; and that care be taken, that the Lord's day be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred and applied to holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes; and that an able, godly, faithful, practical Miniſtry, be planted throughout the Prince his dominions; and that inſufficient, negligent, and ſcandalous Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, be not promoted or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church: This would be the way, to make good men, and good Chriſtians, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently good Subjects, tied faſt to the Ruling Powers, by the bond of Conſcience; without this, other politick courſes will prove inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual; for till obedience be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly yielded unto God, it will not be conſcionably, and ſo not conſtantly yielded to his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: but Chriſtians well inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Word of God, and ſeaſoned with Scripture Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, know, that they muſt needs be ſubject, not onely for wrath, but for Conſcience ſake.</p>
